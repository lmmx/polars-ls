# pols

List directory contents as Polars DataFrames.

## Installation

- Requires installation of either `polars` or `polars-lts-cpu`.

```bash
pip install pols
```

## Differences from `ls`

The design is intended to keep as closely as possible to GNU coreutils
[`ls`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls).

So far one particular divergence is that command line order does not affect `pols`
(e.g. `-aA` vs `-Aa`), but there is no real way to implement this with boolean parameters.
It could be detected for a CLI but for now I'm prioritising feature completeness over CLI
complexity (it is autogenerated from the function signature with
[argh](https://argh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
